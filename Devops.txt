DevOps
DevOps = Development + Operations 
It’s a culture + set of practices + tools that help:
•	Developers (who write code)
•	Operations (who deploy/ manage systems)
Work together, instead of working in silos.
Real time Example:
 Imagine you’re building a mobile app like swiggy.
•	The developer writes code to add “Track My Order” feature.
•	Without DevOps: Developer gives code to Ops team-> they manually deploy -> bugs happen -> delays.
•	With DevOps: Code is automatically tested and deployed -> customers get updates faster and safely.
